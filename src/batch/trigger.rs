//! Batch Trigger Module
//! 
//! This module is a placeholder for batch trigger logic.
//! 
//! # Planned Functionality
//! The batch trigger will determine when batches should be sealed based on:
//! - Time-based triggers (seal batch after timeout, even if not full)
//! - Size-based triggers (seal batch when it reaches max size)
//! - Event-based triggers (seal immediately if forced transactions arrive)
//! - Economic triggers (seal when gas savings threshold is met)
